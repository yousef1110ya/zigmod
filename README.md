# zigmod  
this code is a tool similar to nodemon in node.js , where the main reason for this is to restart the application each time you change something in the system .<br>
I know many people don't like to do this , but I think it's amazing for web development 

## usage 
for now it only detects the changes and does nothing but printing that a file has changed , and you can use it like this : <br>
1. add the zigmod.zig file to your dirctory 
2. edit the path variable `path` in the code 
3. run the file 

## notes 
this code is now on zig 0.14.0 .
